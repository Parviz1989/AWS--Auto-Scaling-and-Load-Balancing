Detailed Steps for Project: Auto Scaling and Load Balancing
Step 1: Set Up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Navigate to ELB Creation:

Access the AWS Management Console.
Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
Under the "Load Balancing" section, select "Load Balancers".
Click “Create Load Balancer”.
Select ELB Type:

Choose between Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic or Network Load Balancer (NLB) for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic based on your application requirements.
Configure ELB:

Enter a name for your load balancer.
Select a scheme (internet-facing for external traffic or internal for internal network traffic).
Set up listeners, defining the protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP) and ports you want the ELB to listen on.
Network Mapping:

Choose the VPC and assign it to subnets in different Availability Zones for high availability.
Security Settings:

For HTTPS listeners, specify SSL certificates and security policies.
Assign security groups that control the traffic allowed to and from the load balancer.
Routing and Target Group:

Define target groups (a group of destination resources, like EC2 instances) for routing traffic.
Set up health checks for the target group to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances.
Review and Create:

Review your configurations and create the load balancer.
Note the DNS name of the ELB; this is used to route traffic to your instances.
Step 2: Configure Auto Scaling Groups
Launch Configuration/Template:

Go to the “Auto Scaling Groups” section on the EC2 Dashboard.
Start by creating a launch configuration or template with instance details such as type, AMI, and key pair.
Create Auto Scaling Group:

Name your group and select the launch configuration or template you created.
Define the size of the group (minimum, maximum, and desired capacity).
Configure Network:

Select the VPC and subnets. Ensure these are the same as those chosen for your ELB for seamless integration.
Scaling Policies:

Create policies based on specific metrics (like CPU utilization) to automatically adjust the number of instances.
Attach to Load Balancer:

Associate your Auto Scaling group with the previously created ELB to ensure new instances are automatically registered with the ELB.
Health Checks and Notifications:

Configure health check grace periods and types to ensure that instances have time to boot and become healthy before being checked.
Optionally, set up notifications to alert you about scaling events.
Review and Launch:

Review your settings, then launch the Auto Scaling group.
Testing and Verification
Load Testing: Perform load testing to simulate traffic and observe how the Auto Scaling group adds or removes instances.
Monitoring: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor metrics and logs. Adjust your configurations based on the performance data.
